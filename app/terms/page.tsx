                        <p>
                            We urge all users to be responsible about their use of this Site and any transaction entered into as a result of either listing a
                            rental car or renting a rental car. We do not own or manage, nor can we contract for, any rental car listed on a Site. The Site
                            provides an on-line marketplace to allow rental car companies who advertise on the Site (each, a “member”) to offer for rent in a
                            variety of pricing formats, a specific rental car to potential renters or renters (each, a “driver” and, collectively with a member,
                            the “users”). “Members“ may also include rental car companies or managers who originally advertised their cars on another website
                            and their listings have been redistributed on the Site. We also may offer online trip or other tools or services to allow users to
                            communicate with each other and enter into rental agreements or other transactions.
                            <br />
                            We are not a party to any rental or other agreement between users. This is true even if the Site allows you to book a rental or
                            provides other ancillary products or services, as the Site may facilitate trip a rental or other tools, services or products, but we
                            are not a party to any rental or other agreement between users. As a result, any part of an actual or potential transaction between
                            a driver and a member, including the quality, condition, safety or legality of the rental cars advertised, the truth or accuracy of
                            the listings (including the content thereof or any review relating to any driver or rental car), the ability of members to rent a
                            rental car or the ability of drivers to contract for rental cars are solely the responsibility of each user. You acknowledge and
                            agree that you may be required to enter into one or more separate agreements, waivers or terms and conditions before making a trip
                            or purchasing a product or service and MyBundee or one of its affiliates may place additional restrictions on your trip, product or
                            service.

                            Site, their use of any tool, service or product offered on the Site and any transaction they enter into on the Site or in connection
                            with their use of the Site.
                            <br />
                            Members further agree that they are responsible for and agree to abide by all laws, rules, ordinances, or regulations applicable to
                            the listing of their rental car and the conduct of their rental business, including but not limited to any and all laws, rules,
                            ordinances, regulations or other requirements relating to taxes, credit cards, data and privacy, permits or license requirements,
                            zoning ordinances, safety compliance and compliance with all anti-discrimination and fair housing laws, as applicable. Please be
                            aware that, even though we are not a party to any rental transaction and assume no liability for legal or regulatory compliance
                            pertaining to rental properties listed on the Site, there may be circumstances where we are nevertheless legally obligated (as we
                            may determine in our sole discretion) to provide information relating to your listing in order to comply with requests from
                            governmental bodies in relation to investigations, litigation or administrative proceedings, and we may choose to comply with such
                            obligations in our sole discretion.

                        <p>
                            User verification on the Internet is difficult and we cannot, and do not assume any responsibility for, the confirmation of each
                            user's purported identity. We encourage you to communicate directly with a driver or member through the tools available on the Site,
                            though even this does not assure you of the identity of the person with which you are communicating. We further encourage you to
                            take other reasonable measures to assure yourself of the other person’s identity and, for drivers, of the rental car and relevant
                            details of your trip or proposed trip.
                            <br />
                            You agree to (i) keep your password and online ID for both your account with us and your email account secure and strictly
                            confidential, providing it only to authorized users of your accounts, (ii) instruct each person to whom you give your online ID and
                            password that he or she is not to disclose it to any unauthorized person, (iii) notify us immediately and select a new online ID and
                            password if you believe your password for either your account with us or your email account may have become known to an unauthorized
                            person, and (iv) notify us immediately if you are contacted by anyone requesting your online ID and password. Further, if we suspect
                            any unauthorized access to your account, upon our request, you agree to promptly change your ID and password and take any other
                            related action as we may reasonably request.

                            permission from the user. You may not use any such information for any unlawful purpose or with any unlawful intent.

                            In all cases, you must give users an opportunity to remove their information from your address book or database or other records and
                            a chance to review what information you have collected about them. In addition, under no circumstances, except as defined in this
                            provision, may you disclose personal information about another user to any third party without the consent of the other user. You
                            agree that other users may use your personal information to communicate with you in accordance with this provision. Further, you
                            agree that you will protect other users’ personal information with the same degree of care that you protect your own confidential
                            information (using at minimum a reasonable standard of care), and you assume all liability for the misuse, loss or unauthorized
                            transfer of such information.

                            We do not tolerate spam or unsolicited commercial electronic communications of any kind. Therefore, without limiting the foregoing,

                        <p>
                            We charge a service fee payable by drivers who book a rental car on the Site via the Site checkout. The service fee covers the use
                            of the Site, including such features as 24/7 user support, and is calculated as a variable percentage of the total reservation
                            amount (which may or may not include additional fees, taxes and damage deposits). Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction of the
                            driver and/or member, VAT may be charged on top of the service fee. The exact service fee (and any VAT, if applicable) charged will
                            be displayed to drivers at the time of trip. The service fee plus applicable VAT will be charged after both the driver and member
                            accept the reservation. The service fee will only be refunded in the event a driver is entitled to a refund of the entire rental
                            amount under the terms of the cancellation policy presented in the listing. Any taxes alleged to be owed by any taxing authority on
                            the service fee are the responsibility of MyBundee and members have no responsibility for any such claimed tax liability. Members

                            Vrbo allows drivers to display prices on the Site in the currency of their choice and may also allow drivers to pay in the currency

                            the best rate available. If your currency of choice is not supported for a trip, you’ll be charged in the owner’s selected currency.
                            In any event, the currency and exact amount you will pay will be displayed clearly at check out. Our overall compensation may be
                            affected by the currency you choose to pay in. Note that if you pay in a currency different than the currency of your card, your
                            bank or card provider may charge you foreign exchange, transaction, or other fees.

                        <p>
                            Please read this Section carefully. It requires that any and all claims be resolved by binding arbitration or in small claims court,
                            and it prevents you from pursuing a class action or similar proceeding in any forum. Arbitration is required if your country of
                            residence enforces arbitration agreements, including without limitation, the United States. If you are outside the United States but
                            attempt to bring a claim in the United States, arbitration is required for determination of the threshold issue of whether this
                            dispute resolution section applies to you, as well as all other threshold determinations, including residency, arbitrarily, venue,
                            and applicable law. If your country of residence does not enforce arbitration agreements, the mandatory pre-arbitration dispute
                            resolution and notification and prohibition on class actions or representative proceedings provided below still apply to the extent
                            enforceable by law.
                            <br />

                            dispute resolution process that includes: (1) investigation and negotiation of your claim with our Driver Support team. and, if
                            necessary, (2) binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) or, for arbitrations outside of the
                            United States, an agreed upon arbitral tribunal. You and us each retain the right to seek relief in small claims court as an
                            alternative to arbitration.

                            limit, then either you or us may elect to have the claims heard in small claims court, rather than in arbitration, at any time
                            before the arbitrator is appointed, or in accord with the AAA rules, by notifying the other party of that election in writing.

                            Arbitration rules and governing law This Arbitration Agreement is a “written agreement to arbitrate” evidencing a transaction in
                            interstate commerce. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs all substantive and procedural interpretation and enforcement of
                            this provision. The arbitration will be administered by AAA in accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules or other AAA
                            arbitration rules determined to be applicable by the AAA (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified here. The AAA Rules
                            are available at www.adr.org. The arbitrator shall apply the law of the state of Washington, regardless of conflict of laws
                            principles, except that the FAA governs all provisions relating to arbitration. Foreign laws do not apply. This Arbitration
                            Agreement can only be amended by mutual agreement in writing. Mandatory pre-arbitration dispute resolution and notification Prior to
                            initiating arbitration, you agree to give us the opportunity to resolve any Claims by notifying us of the Claim in writing and
                            attempting in good faith to negotiate an informal resolution. You must send, by certified mail, a written and signed Notice of
                            Dispute (“Notice”) to MyBundee Inc’s current mailing address.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Notice must contain the following information: (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) the email address you used to make your
                            reservation, (4) a brief description of the nature of your complaint, (5) the resolution that you are seeking, and (6) your
                            signature. If we are not able to resolve your complaint within 60 days of you providing Notice, you may commence an arbitration
                            proceeding. Engaging in this pre-arbitration dispute resolution and notification process is a requirement that must be fulfilled
                            before commencing arbitration. AAA does not have authority to administer or adjudicate the Claim unless and until all
                            Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification requirements have been met. The statute of limitations shall be tolled while the
                            parties engage in the dispute resolution process required by this Section.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Commencing arbitration <br /> To initiate arbitration, you must file the Demand with the AAA as specified in the AAA Rules. The AAA
                            provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. A party
                            initiating an arbitration against us must send the written Demand for Arbitration to Legal Department/Dispute Resolution Provision,
                            Expedia, Inc., 1111 Expedia Group Way West, Seattle, WA, 98119 concurrent with filing the Demand with AAA. Arbitration shall be
                            conducted by a single arbitrator selected in accordance with the AAA Rules or by mutual agreement between you and us. The
                            Arbitration shall be held either: (i) at a location determined by AAA pursuant to the AAA Rules (provided that such location is
                            reasonably convenient for you and does not require travel in excess of 100 miles from your home or place of business). or (ii) at
                            such other location as may be mutually agreed upon by you and us. or (iii) via video conference. or (iv) at your election, if the
                            only claims in the arbitration are asserted by you and are for less than $40,000 in aggregate, by telephone or by written submission
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Attorneys’ fees and costs <br />
                            Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules, and where appropriate, limited
                            by the AAA Consumer Rules. In order to initiate arbitration, each party will be responsible for paying the filing fees required by
                            the AAA, which are approximately equivalent to current court filing fees. In the event that you are able to demonstrate that the
                            costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, or you would otherwise be eligible for a fee waiver
                            in court, we will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary
                            to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, regardless of the outcome of the
                            arbitration, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim(s) were frivolous or asserted in bad faith. Either party may make a
                            request that the arbitrator award attorneys’ fees and costs upon proving that the other party has asserted a claim, cross-claim, or
                            defense that is groundless in fact or law, brought in bad faith or for the purpose of harassment, or is otherwise frivolous, as
                            allowed by applicable law and the AAA Rules
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Arbitrator’s decision <br /> There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited under the
                            FAA. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator bases the award. Judgment
                            on the arbitration award may be entered in any court with proper jurisdiction. The arbitrator may award any relief allowed by law or
                            the AAA Rules, but declaratory or injunctive relief may be awarded only on an individual basis and only to the extent necessary to
                            provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Severability and survival <br /> If any portion of this Disputes and Arbitration Provision is found to be unenforceable or unlawful
                            for any reason, (1) such portion will be severed and the remainder of the Provision will be given full force and effect. and (2) to
                            the extent that any Claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative basis, such Claims must be
                            litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties agree that litigation of those claims
                            shall be stayed pending the outcome of any individual Claims in arbitration. Driver support and the handling of complaints For

                            Notification of any amendment will be posted on the Site by the indication of the last amendment date at the top of these Terms and
                            will be effective immediately. When members renew subscriptions, the terms in effect at the time of renewal will govern, provided

                            or any other additional or new order of any product or service will govern for such renewal or other order. The fees and commissions
                            applicable to pay-per-trip listings offered on one or more Sites will be displayed under the “List Your Car” tab when such product
                            is generally made available on a Site or shall be otherwise set forth in a communication between us and the member. The types of

                            the rental car listed by such member. (ii) it will not wrongfully withhold a rental deposit in breach of the underlying rental
                            agreement. (iii) it will accurately describe the subject rental car, will not fail to disclose a material defect in, or material
                            information about, a rental car and will upon request, or otherwise from time to time, review the rental car listing content and

                            We cannot guarantee that your listing will appear in any specific order in search results on the Site. Search order will fluctuate
                            based on a variety of factors such as search parameters, subscription level purchased, listing quality, how frequently a calendar is
                            updated, driver preferences, member response time, reservation history, online trip capability, compliance with posted listing
                            practice requirements, and other factors that we may deem important to the user experience from time to time (“Best Match”). Listing
                            appearance or order in any particular search result may also vary depending on the search criteria used by the particular driver. We
                            reserve the right to apply various search algorithms or to use methods to optimize Best Match results for particular drivers’
                            experiences and the overall marketplace. Listings may not always appear in search results. Listings distributed on third-party sites
                            are not guaranteed to display on such third-party site in any particular order or at all. Search results and order may appear
                            different on Bundee’s mobile application than they appear on the Site. To optimize the search experience for both members and
                            drivers and improve the Best Match process, MyBundee retains the right to run occasional tests that will be limited in duration but
                            may alter how we display listings and search results.

                        <p>
                            There are limited ways in which a member may use our trademarks or logos in connection with a listing without specific prior written
                            authorization. The following are general guidelines. It is usually permissible for you to refer to MyBundee or the name of one of
                            our affiliate websites on which you list your rental car in a descriptive manner in your listing on the Site or in other permissible
                            communications. For example, you might say “Check out my rental car on MyBundee,“ or “I list properties on MyBundee.“ However, you
                            may not refer to MyBundee or any of our affiliates in any way that might lead someone to believe that your company, rental, listing
                            or site is sponsored by, affiliated with, or endorsed by MyBundee or one of our affiliates. For example, you may not say “Bundee
                            sponsors my vacation rental,” or describe your rental car as “Bundee’s best vacation rental.” You may not use the MyBundee name or
                            one of our affiliates’ names on any other website that lists vacation rentals without our prior written authorization.

                            above or with our prior written authorization. If you want permission to use our name and/or logo in any other manner, including,
                            without limitation, on any website, business card, signage, t-shirt, etc., or if you have other questions, you may visit help.

                        <p>
                            Each listing must relate to an individual and uniquely identified rental car. This means that: The rental car in a listing may not
                            be substituted for another rental without our consent. We may approve a request in our discretion if the rental car manager's
                            contract for the rental was terminated and the member provides sufficient proof, as requested by us, and completes any additional
                            forms we may request. The type and term of the listing for any substituted rental car shall be the same as the type and term of the
                            originally-listed rental car (i.e., the term will not be extended past the original term). If a member submits changes to an
                            existing listing that, if approved, would substantially alter the listing to make it that of another rental car, then we have the
                            right to terminate the listing and may choose, in our sole discretion, to retain any fees associated previously existing listing as
                            compensation for the violation of this condition.

                        <p>
                            No member may request any driver to mail cash, or utilize any instant-cash wire transfer service such as Western Union or MoneyGram
                            in payment for all or part of a rental car transaction. Any violation of this term or any other unacceptable payment methods that
                            may be posted on the Site may result in the immediate removal of the non-conforming listing from the Site without notice to the
                            member and without refund. From time to time, we may become aware of users attempting to conduct a transaction that would involve an
                            unauthorized payment method or a fraudulent payment method. Ideally, we hope to be able to assist users in avoiding such
                            transactions, but we assume no liability or responsibility to do so or to inform users of any such actual or suspected activity.
                            Users’ bank or credit card companies may impose certain fees or charges, including, but not limited to, foreign transaction fees,
                            related to any rental of a rental car. It is the user’s obligation to review any agreement with its bank or credit card company
                            concerning any such fees

                        <p>
                            Payment for subscription listings must be made to us in U.S. Dollars paid either by major credit or debit card, PayPal, or a check
                            drawn on a U.S. bank. For any subscription paid for by credit card or PayPal, such subscription shall automatically renew at the
                            expiration of the then-current term for an additional term of the same duration (as the previous term) and at the then-current
                            non-promotional subscription rate. If such subscription was purchased by check or another form of payment other than by credit card
                            or PayPal (if such other payment form was permitted), such subscription shall not be automatically renewed. The automatic renewal
                            feature allows your service to remain uninterrupted at the expiration of your then-current term. If you wish to turn off
                            auto-renewal, you must log on to your account and manually turn off auto-renewal in your owner dashboard at least five (5) days
                            prior to expiration of the then-current term. Upon any such turning off of auto-renewal, your subscription will remain active
                            through the expiration of your then-current subscription term. however your subscription will not be automatically renewed upon the
                            expiration of your then-current term. If your subscription does not auto-renew or expires at the end of your then-current
                            subscription term and you desire to renew your subscription, you will be required to pay the then-current non-promotional
                            subscription rate to renew your subscription or to activate a new subscription. If you do not turn off auto-renewal and you continue
                            to use our subscription service, you re-affirm and authorize us to charge your form of payment at the end of each subscription term
                            for an additional term of the same duration as the initial term and at the then-current, non-promotional subscription rate for the
                            same product or service.
                            <br />
                            If the product or service that you last purchased has changed in any way or is no longer offered, you agree and authorize us to
                            charge your form of payment at the renewal of your subscription term for a product or service that is the most similar, as
                            determined by us, to the product or service that you previously purchased, even if the price of such product or service is not the
                            same as the prior product or service that you purchased. You agree to be responsible for any such charges, and we reserve the right
                            to obtain payment directly from you if necessary. <br />
                            If you wish to change your form of payment to be charged or if your form of payment information otherwise changes, see
                            help.MyBundee.com for information on updating the payment information in your owner dashboard, as applicable or to provide the new
                            or different form of payment information. If a Site enables you to list your rental car on a basis other than by subscription, you
                            agree to pay us compensation as described to you in the registration process, which compensation may be changed by us from time to
                            time without notice by us displaying the compensation on the Site on which you registered for the listing. The registration process
                            and additional notices you may receive from us may also provide additional terms and conditions for such listings.

                        <p>
                            All subscription listings are sold to run the full term that is chosen by the member. The term starts on the date that the member
                            submits the full or initial (as applicable) payment and expires one year thereafter. For example, for an annual subscription term,
                            if the member submits payment for the subscription on July 1st, the subscription would expire on June 30 of the following year. If
                            you renew your subscription listing, or if your subscription listing automatically renews, your listing will remain online for the
                            new subscription period without refund. <br />
                            Generally, no refunds are available unless a member qualifies for a refund under any special program we may have in effect. If you
                            believe you qualify for a refund, you may contact customer support by sending your request to the address listed under “Contact Us”
                            above and include your listing number, and your reason for requesting a refund. We will then determine, in our sole discretion,
                            whether any refund is due. If you sell your rental car and no longer wish for the listing to remain online, please contact us and we
                            can remove the listing. however, no refund will be owed.
